# Translate Telephone

Remember playing telephone with your friends?  Start with a phrase, pass it along, and see what the last person *thinks* the phrase was.  Let's do that via language translation.

1. take a phrase as input from the user
2. translate it to another language
3. translate that phrase to *another* language
4. continue translating across a few more languages
5. translate back to the original language
6. see what the end result is!
